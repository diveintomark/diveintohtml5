<h2 id="illustrations">Illustrations</h2>

<p>This book includes illustrations from the <a href="http://openclipart.org">Open Clip Art Library</a>, all of which are old enough that they have passed into the public domain.

<p>In addition, the drop caps at the beginning of each chapter are from <a href="http://www.psymon.com/initials/children.html">The Alphabet of Children</a>. These illustrations are also in the public domain.

<p>The live video example at the end of <a href="video.html">Video on the Web</a> uses a poster image called <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brownpau/3733021577/">From Grandma's Basement: Apple IIe</a> by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/brownpau/">Paulo Ordoveza</a>.

letters); and a variety of other characters, such as oddball
punctuation, numerals, etc.

TrueType and PostScript forms are available.
